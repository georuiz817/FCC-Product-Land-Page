               <h4 id='label'>What does it do?</h4>
               <p name='what'>The whole concept of air frying sounds like a miracle. Frying without fat? How is that possible? Like many things that sound mysterious, it actually has a very reasonable explanation. But before I reveal it, let me make it clear that air frying is NOT frying. To really fry you need to submerge food in oil. No way around it. But what an air fryer can do is give you that crispy, crunch that makes Southern fried chicken or a french fry so delectable. Got it? </p>
               <h4 id='label'>How an Air Fryer Works</h4>
               <p class='text-primary'>An air fryer is actually a lot like a countertop convection oven. It’s a small electric appliance with a heating element and a fan that blows air around in a cooking chamber. However, in an air fryer, the air is swirled very quickly in a circular fashion — so it does a better job of reaching all of the surfaces of the food and creating a crisp crust. Plus, the food itself sits in a perforated basket which increases its contact with the hot moving air. Another thing that makes a big difference? The fact that there’s not much space between the walls of the chamber, and the basket intensifies the heat.</p>
